# Welcome to Deh's Market Backend!

Inspired on https://github.com/dehcastro/dehsmarket project, created to help people to facilitate TDD sessions, I resolved to create the Deh's market backend to help people to facilitate BDD sessions.

## Where we are

At this point of the project, Features Written tag, all we have is the features of our backend specified. Feel free and comfortable to implement the feature as you want.
 
## Project 

The project stack, at this point, is Java 17 + Cucumber + Junit + AssertJ + Mockito. As it is in a very initial stage, nothing much complex is done. The idea is to evolve the project until it becomes a usable backend to Deh's Market frontend.

## Executing the project

At this point, all you can do is execute `./gradlew cucumber` to get Cucumber suggested snippets to implement your own steps.
